# VirtualVisitors
**Description of the project:** The Virtual Visitor Tracker is a web-based tool designed to help businesses optimize their digital marketing strategies by collecting and analyzing real-time demographic and geographical data from website visitors using the IP Stack API. The project aims to provide businesses with valuable insights into their customer base, allowing them to tailor content, services, and marketing efforts to specific regional and demographic audiences. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap for the front end, and Node.js and a SQL database for the back end, the tool presents real-time visitor data through dynamic charts and graphs. Key pages include a Home Page displaying visitor analytics, an About Page outlining the company's mission and team, and a Help Page for FAQs and search functionality. The project targets website owners and marketers looking to improve user targeting and sales performance by leveraging detailed visitor data, thereby enhancing content and marketing campaigns with data-driven insights.\

It will work on Windows, macOS, and Linux and support the main desktop browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. The tool will be compatible with the most popular mobile browsers, including Google Chrome on Android and Safari on iOS. Users will be able to use the tool and engage with real-time data on any device or screen size thanks to the completely responsive design, which makes use of Bootstrap to deliver a smooth and aesthetically consistent experience across PCs, tablets, and smartphones.
